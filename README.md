# wordguessgame

This is a Hangman game created with Javascript and Jquery. The game takes in letter guesses and reveals if the guess correct and part of the word or not. Words are chosen randomly from an array. If the word is not completed after a limited number of guesses, the hangman is built and the player loses. If all correct letters are revealed, the user wins.
